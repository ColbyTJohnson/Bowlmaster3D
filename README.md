## About Bowlmaster

### The Game
The game was designed by Ben Tristem and was developed by myself as part of working through his [Unity/C# Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/learn/v4/overview). The project taught Test-Driven Development by programming a 10-frame bowling game from scratch, and was built to iOS, Android, and Windows/MacOS.
